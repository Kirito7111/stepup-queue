## Overview

StepUp Queue is designed to streamline the management of queued jobs within a StepUp framework. It is particularly useful in educational and research settings where reproducibility and efficiency are crucial. This tool leverages Python's `asyncio` for handling asynchronous tasks, making it suitable for parallel processing on Linux systems.

The integration with job schedulers like SLURM allows users to manage resources effectively, ensuring that tasks run smoothly and without unnecessary delays.

## Features

- **Asynchronous Job Handling**: Utilize Python's `asyncio` for efficient job scheduling.
- **Integration with SLURM**: Seamlessly connect with SLURM to manage job execution on high-performance computing clusters.
- **Reproducibility**: Maintain a consistent environment for job execution, crucial for research and educational purposes.
- **Terminal Application**: Operate directly from the terminal for ease of use and flexibility.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Designed to work on Linux and POSIX-compliant systems.

## Installation

To get started with StepUp Queue, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kirito7111/stepup-queue.git
   cd stepup-queue
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. You can install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Download the Latest Release**:
   Visit the [Releases section](https://github.com/Kirito7111/stepup-queue/releases) to download the latest version. Follow the instructions in the release notes for installation and execution.

## Usage

Using StepUp Queue is straightforward. Hereâ€™s a simple example to help you get started:

1. **Define Your Jobs**: Create a Python script to define the jobs you want to run.
   ```python
   import asyncio

   async def my_job(job_id):
       print(f"Starting job {job_id}")
       await asyncio.sleep(2)  # Simulate a long-running job
       print(f"Finished job {job_id}")

   async def main():
       jobs = [my_job(i) for i in range(5)]
       await asyncio.gather(*jobs)

   if __name__ == "__main__":
       asyncio.run(main())
   ```

2. **Run Your Jobs**: Execute your script from the terminal.
   ```bash
   python my_script.py
   ```

3. **Monitor Job Status**: Use the built-in monitoring tools to check the status of your jobs.

For more detailed instructions, refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.
